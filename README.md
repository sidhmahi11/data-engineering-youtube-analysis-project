# Data Engineering YouTube Analysis Project 

# Overview
This project focuses on securely managing, streamlining, and analyzing structured and semi-structured YouTube video data based on video categories and trending metrics.

Key Features and Achievements
Data Ingestion: Built a mechanism to ingest data from multiple sources, including Kaggle datasets containing YouTube video statistics.

ETL System: Transformed raw data into a structured format using AWS Glue and Python.

Data Lake: Centralized data storage using Amazon S3 for efficient data management.

Scalability: Designed a system that scales with increasing data volumes using AWS services.

Cloud Integration: Leveraged AWS Lambda, Athena, and Glue for serverless data processing and querying.

Reporting: Created an interactive dashboard using Amazon QuickSight to analyze YouTube video trends and metrics.

Tools and Technologies Used
AWS Services: S3 (data storage), IAM (access management), Glue (ETL), Lambda (serverless computing), Athena (querying), QuickSight (BI reporting).

Python: For data processing and scripting.

Pandas: For data cleaning and transformation.

Kaggle Dataset: Utilized YouTube video statistics data, including video titles, channel titles, views, likes, dislikes, and comments.

Project Workflow
Data Ingestion: Collected raw data from Kaggle datasets, which included CSV and JSON files for different regions.

ETL Process:

Cleaned and transformed raw data using AWS Glue and Python.

Organized data into a structured format for analysis.

Data Lake: Stored processed data in Amazon S3 for centralized access and scalability.

Data Analysis:

Used AWS Athena to query data directly from S3.

Analyzed video trends, categories, and performance metrics.

Reporting:

Built an interactive dashboard using Amazon QuickSight.

Visualized key insights, such as trending videos, popular categories, and engagement metrics.

Outcome
Scalable Data Pipeline: Developed a robust and scalable data engineering solution for YouTube video analysis.

Actionable Insights: Provided detailed insights into YouTube video trends, enabling data-driven decision-making.

Interactive Dashboard: Created a user-friendly dashboard for visualizing and exploring YouTube data
